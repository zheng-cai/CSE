Description
-------------

This program uses Monte Carlo method to integration. We can define a f(x) which is larger than 0 and given an proper  interval [a,b], this program will get the integral computation  under different volume of random points. And it will test if f(x) can be integrated between a and b and if the inputs of a and b are valid.


Installation
------------

To install, simply run

    gcc main.c -std=c99 -o A1

Note: The -std=c99 flag is required on some C compilers
to allow variable declarations at arbitrary locations in
a function.

Execution
-----------

Assuming your executable is called "hangman", run it using

    ./A1
